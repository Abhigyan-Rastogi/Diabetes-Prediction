Things to do!
1. Read data from csv file, make a datastruture                                                         DONE> 19:36 26/12/23
2. implement efficient matrix multiplication for neural network                                         DONE> ??:?? 26/12/23
3. implement a class which handles Input layer, Middle layer, Output layer                              DONE> ??:?? 26/12/23
4. implement a datastructure that can store the weights/biases of layers for reuse at a later time      
5. implement reusability without having to re train
6. make a webpage for the project, UI, login, submission, server handling, etc.
7. Time yourself

Big ass project to implement neural network by myself, saved for later (research and development)

using existing neuralNetwork libraries

1.Layer Architecture
2.Bias and weight update

Getting somewhere with weka!

Implemented Diabetes predictions with WEKA!                                                             DONE> 28/12/2023 21:11
